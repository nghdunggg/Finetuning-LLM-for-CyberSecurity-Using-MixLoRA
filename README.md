# Large Language Model (LLM) Fine-tuning for Cyber Security
---
This project outlines a comprehensive process for **Fine-tuning** a Large Language Model (LLM) from the Hugging Face Hub. It leverages advanced libraries such as **Transformers**, **PEFT** (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), and **TRL** (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) to optimize performance and memory usage during training.

The core file of this project is **`main.ipynb`**, which is best executed in a **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook** environment with GPU support.

## üéØ Project Goals

* **Performance Enhancement:** Improve the base model's capabilities on a specific, custom dataset and task.
* **Resource Optimization:** Utilize techniques like **LoRA** or **QLoRA** to significantly reduce VRAM requirements, making it feasible to train large models on consumer-grade or mid-tier GPUs.
* **Streamlined Workflow:** Establish a clear, reproducible workflow for loading, fine-tuning, and optionally pushing the trained model artifacts to the **Hugging Face Hub**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements and Setup

To run the notebook successfully, you must install the necessary Python libraries and meet the hardware requirements.

### 1. Installation

Open the `main.ipynb` file and execute the initial cells to install the required packages.

```bash
%pip install transformers peft datasets accelerate bitsandbytes
%pip install -U trl
%pip install -U transformers peft trl accelerate
```

# 2. Hardware and Environment
* **GPU**: A dedicated NVIDIA GPU is mandatory (a Tesla T4 or higher is highly recommended) due to the demanding nature of LLM training.
* **VRAM**: Even with optimization techniques, you should have at least 12GB of VRAM available to fine-tune standard 7B models.
* **Environment Cleanup**: The notebook includes cells using gc.collect() and torch.cuda.empty_cache() to manage and free up GPU memory‚Äîrun these frequently.

# 3. Hugging Face Configuration (Optional)
If you plan to download private models or upload your final fine-tuned model, you will need to authenticate:
* Ensure you have a Hugging Face Token with write access.
* Run the code cell that contains huggingface_hub.login() and follow the prompts to enter your token.
# How to Use
## 1. Open and Review
Open the main.ipynb file in your chosen environment (Colab is recommended for ease of use).

## 2. Configure Training
* Model & Dataset: Update the paths and names for your desired base model and custom dataset.
* Hyperparameters: Review and adjust the key parameters within the Training Configuration section (e.g., LoRA rank, alpha, batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs).

## 3. Execute the Notebook
Run each code cell sequentially:
1. Load the base Model and Tokenizer (in 4-bit quantization if using QLoRA).
2. Load and preprocess your custom dataset.
3. Configure the PEFT LoraConfig.
4. Initialize the TRL SFTTrainer with the defined training arguments.
5. Start the training process by calling trainer.train().

## 4. Evaluation and Deployment
* Once training is complete, the notebook will save the final adapter weights.
* Run the Evaluation cells to test the model's performance on example prompts.
* If satisfied, run the final cell to Push the model and tokenizer to the Hugging Face Hub.
